## Installation

npm i winduum-elements
```

```js
import { Drawer } from 'winduum-elements/components/drawer/index.js'

customElements.define('x-drawer', Drawer, { extends: 'dialog' })
```

### Local imports
By default, imports are directly from `npm` so you can leverage updates.
Alternatively, you can also copy and paste the code from this directory to your project and remap the imports to local.

```js
import { Drawer } from '@/components/ui/drawer/index.js'
```
